        <h1>What are the advantages of div tag?</h1>
        <p>The Div is the most usable tag in web development because it helps us to separate out data in the web page and we can create a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages. It is used to group various tags of HTML so that sections can be created and styles can be applied to them.</p>

        <h1>What is the point of the div tag?</h1>
        <p>The div tag in HTML is a container that is used to group other HTML elements together and apply styles to them as a unit. It doesn't have any semantic meaning and is used purely for layout purposes. When you want to group a set of elements together, you can simply wrap them in a div tag.</p>
